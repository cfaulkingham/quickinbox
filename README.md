# Quickinbox

Self-hosted email for your own domain, running on Cloudflare Workers.
Get `you@yourdomain.com` with a full web client — no third-party mailbox,
no servers to maintain.

## Features

- **Real mail in and out** — the provider delivers straight into the Worker, nothing is polled
- **Threads** — replies group into conversations, quoted history collapses; conversations never mix messages from different domains
- **Attachments** — inbound files land in R2, outbound files upload from the composer
- **Inline images** — insert, paste, or drop PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP images into new messages and replies; images are preserved in saved drafts and sent as embedded attachments (5 MB per file, 5 files total including ordinary attachments)
- **Safe HTML** — received HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe
- **Multiple domains and users** — per-user addresses, admin catch-all, unrouted-mail view; the combined inbox tags each conversation with the address it arrived on and can filter by it
- **Delivery status** — delivered / bounced / complained tracking
- **REST API, CLI, and MCP server** — send and read mail from scripts, the terminal, or AI agents
- **Hosted MCP with OAuth** — paste `https://your-instance/mcp` into Claude, Cursor, or ChatGPT and approve access in the browser; disconnect apps from Settings
- **Inbox tabs** — optional TypeSafe classification into Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, Forums, plus a spam mailbox
- **Import / Export** — import EML messages or ZIP archives; export mailbox, label, and date selections as EML in ZIP files
- **Contacts** — a private address book with multiple email addresses, favorites, search, and recipient suggestions in both interfaces; save a sender from a message, compose to a contact, or invite them to an event
- **Calendar** — month, week, and agenda views; timed and all-day events with time zones, guest invitations, updates, cancellations, in-message RSVP, and reminders
- **Interface choices** — choose Zero (adjustable panes and docked compose) or Classic (traditional mailbox and full-page compose) in Settings → Appearance → Interface; both interfaces offer no-split, vertical, and horizontal layouts with separately saved preferences
- Light and dark themes

## Quick start

Click **Deploy to Cloudflare** above, or run the setup wizard locally:

```bash
bun run setup
# if bun isn't installed yet:
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

The button's deploy command applies D1 migrations (the `users` table and the
rest of the schema). If an older deploy left you with `no such table: users`,
run this once against that Worker, then reload:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --remote
```

The wizard creates the D1 database and R2 bucket, writes config, and onboards
your domain. Budget about 30 minutes — most of that is waiting on DNS.

The Deploy to Cloudflare form includes an optional `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` for inbox
tabs. Keep the placeholder to skip. `bun run setup` asks for the same key.

You need:

1. A domain you control
2. A [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com) account
3. Either a [Resend](https://resend.com) account, **or** the domain on Cloudflare DNS plus a Workers paid plan

## Updating an existing install

If you already deployed from this repo, pulling updates only changes the product name in the UI and docs. It does **not** rename your Worker, D1 database, or R2 bucket — leave those as they are (often `quickmail` / `quickmail-attachments`). Existing `qm_live_` API keys keep working, and `quickmail` remains a CLI alias.

### Contacts and calendar

Apply migrations through `0030_organizer_parity.sql` before deploying this version (`bun run deploy`
applies migrations automatically). Contacts and events use the existing D1
database; calendar email attachments use R2 and the existing durable Outbox.
Keep the existing once-per-minute scheduled trigger enabled for invitation
delivery and reminders. No new bindings or Google account are required.

Open **Contacts** or **Calendar** from the navigation. A message's **Save contact**
and **Create event** links connect mail to both tools. In recipient fields,
type a contact's name or address, choose with the arrow keys and Enter, or keep
typing; Tab advances to the next form field.

Saving an event with guests queues invitation emails. Editing it sends updates;
removing a guest or cancelling sends cancellation notices. Incoming `.ics`
invitations offer Accept, Maybe, and Decline inside the message. Guest replies
and cancellations offer an explicit action to update the calendar. Open an
event's **Invitation delivery** section or **Outbox** to inspect delivery errors.

Reminders appear while the app is open, and use browser push when enabled in
Settings → Notifications. Push is best effort; in-app reminders remain available
until dismissed or the event ends. A due reminder is normally picked up within
one minute. Add up to five reminders per event and snooze a due reminder for ten
minutes. Events and calendars can be downloaded as `.ics` files.

Contacts now support groups, birthdays, favorites, and people without an email
address. **Find duplicates** suggests contacts with matching names; review the
primary contact before merging. Emails, groups and notes are combined, and
conflicting details are retained in notes. Groups of up to 30 contacts also appear
in recipient suggestions. **Import / Export** previews vCard or Google Contacts
CSV files before importing; existing email addresses are skipped.

Calendar includes a timed week grid with overlapping appointments. Click an hour
to create an event, or drag an event to a new hour and review the change before
saving. **Calendar settings** adds personal calendars and saves your display time
zone. Search filters the visible period. You can respond to invitations directly
from event details.

Daily, weekly, monthly and yearly series support 1–366 occurrences, with edits or
cancellations for this occurrence, this and following occurrences, or all events.
Repeat times follow the event's time zone across DST. Invalid month dates and
nonexistent DST times are skipped. Changing the series schedule after editing
individual occurrences requires explicitly confirming that those edits can reset.
Guests and reminder settings apply to the whole series.

Calendar file import creates personal copies with no guests or reminders and
sends no mail. It skips existing event UIDs and reports unsupported items. Supported
recurring ICS uses the same finite COUNT rules; BYDAY, UNTIL, RDATE, unbounded rules,
and standalone recurrence updates are reported instead of partially imported.
Files are limited to 2 MB; contact imports support 2,000 contacts and calendar
imports support 500 events/series. See the [parity roadmap](docs/mail-parity.md)
for detailed limits and remaining collaboration, localization, and Google sync work.

### Importing and exporting mail

Apply `0028_mail_transfer.sql` before serving this version. The normal
`bun run deploy` command applies migrations first. This feature uses the existing
D1 database and R2 bucket; no additional services are needed.

Open **Settings → Import / Export** (in the classic theme, scroll down in Settings).

- Import `.eml` files or `.zip` archives into one of your addresses and choose
  Inbox, Archive, Sent, Spam, or Trash. Imports are marked read and preserve the
  original message date. They do not send mail, trigger notifications, classify
  messages, or unarchive existing conversations.
- Optionally apply a label and preserve ZIP folder paths as labels. A selected
  label becomes the parent, e.g. `Imported/Projects/2025`. These are labels, not
  nested mailbox folders; paths must fit the existing 40-character label limit.
- Imports accept up to 500 MiB of selected files and expanded mail, and 10,000
  messages at a time. Each EML is limited to 20 MiB, with at most five attachments
  of 5 MiB each. Oversized, encrypted, corrupt, or unsupported files are reported.
  Keep the page open; Stop finishes the current message before stopping. Retrying
  skips duplicates in the current account by original file hash or Message-ID.
- Export all mail or filter by address, mailbox, label, and inclusive UTC dates.
  Drafts and pending outbox messages are excluded. Large selections split into
  ZIP downloads of at most 1,000 messages and roughly 400 MiB each; download every
  part. A selection may contain up to 100,000 messages. Exports stream directly
  to the browser's download manager.
- Imported messages export their original MIME verbatim. Other messages export
  EML reconstructed from stored message fields, including attachments and inline
  Content-IDs. Headers that were never stored cannot be recovered. Read/starred
  state and label assignments are not encoded in EML; a label-filtered export
  uses the label path as its ZIP directory.
- Each ZIP contains `export-report.json`. Check `complete` and `failures` before
  treating the export as complete: messages with missing stored files are listed
  there and omitted rather than exported as partial EML. Exports are not an atomic
  snapshot of mail being edited during the download.

This is file-based migration; direct IMAP, PST, and MBOX imports are not included.
Use the separate admin maintenance archive for an export of application metadata.

### Durable sending, image privacy, and maintenance

Apply migration `0026_outbox_and_maintenance.sql` before serving the updated
Worker. The normal `bun run deploy` command applies migrations before deployment.
Keep the `* * * * *` Cron Trigger in `wrangler.jsonc`; it recovers pending sends
once a minute. No additional Cloudflare resources are required.

- **Outbox** saves the full message and attachments before contacting the mail
  provider. It shows waiting, sending, accepted, failed, and uncertain states.
  “Accepted by provider” does not mean the recipient received it. Resend delivery
  webhooks continue to update the message, including events arriving before the
  original send response. Both themes show delivery status in the reader.
- Temporary Resend failures reuse the exact saved payload and idempotency key,
  with at most five automatic attempts and a 23-hour retry window (inside
  Resend's 24-hour key retention). Explicit Cloudflare rate-limit rejections can
  be retried. Cloudflare's sending binding does not expose an idempotency key,
  so interrupted or ambiguous sends require review and a duplicate-risk
  acknowledgement before a manual retry. Messages are never automatically
  switched to another provider.
- REST send, reply, and forward requests accept an `Idempotency-Key` header
  (1–200 printable ASCII characters). Reuse it when retrying the same request;
  different content under the same key is rejected. Browser composers generate
  keys automatically, and sending a saved draft uses its draft ID. Hosted MCP
  `send_message` and `reply` accept an optional `idempotencyKey`. A successful
  API response includes `state`; HTTP 202 means the message is durably saved but
  has not been confirmed accepted. Inspect Outbox before submitting it again.
- **Remote images** are blocked by default, including CSS background images
  and `srcset` sources. Stored inline attachments remain available. “Load images”
  permits images for the current message view; “Always allow this sender” saves
  an account-specific preference. Remove permissions in **Settings → General →
  Remote images**. Sender addresses alone are not proof of authenticity.
- **Admin → Maintenance** shows storage usage, recent processing and delivery
  errors, the outbox worker's last run, and MX/SPF/DMARC record checks. DNS checks
  establish record presence, not successful delivery; verify DKIM and routing
  in the provider dashboard. Processing errors are retained for 30 days.

The maintenance page can download a streaming JSONL archive of all accounts'
mail and attachments, addresses, domains, labels, and image preferences. It
excludes authentication credentials and is not a transactional system backup.
The final `complete` record reports row counts and missing attachments; a file
without that record is incomplete. For disaster recovery, export D1 and copy
the **entire** R2 bucket, including `outbox/`, and preserve configuration and
secrets separately. Pause sending and review pending jobs before enabling the
scheduled worker on a restored database, to avoid replaying old sends.

### Drafts, search, and inbox cleanup

Migration `0027_mail_workflows.sql` adds the search index, draft versions, sender
rules, and cleanup history. Apply it before deploying this version; it indexes
existing messages and maintains the index as mail changes.

- Both composers autosave after a short pause, including attachments. The URL
  points to the saved draft for refresh recovery. A failed save keeps the composer
  open and offers retry; another tab cannot silently overwrite a newer version.
  Refreshing with unsaved changes prompts before leaving. Saved snapshots are in
  R2 under `drafts/` and are included in mail archives.
- **Search** covers mail across folders with sender, recipient (including Cc/Bcc),
  date, and attachment filters, highlighted matches, and paginated results. Spam
  and Trash are optional. Search matches word prefixes using D1 FTS5; multiple
  words must all occur. The command palette links to the full results page.
- Archive and Trash show **Undo** for ten minutes. Undo restores prior state only
  for messages that have not received a newer cleanup action. Failed actions
  offer retry, reusing the original request identifier.
- **Snooze** offers presets and a local date/time picker. Snoozed conversations
  leave the inbox and unread count until their wake time; a new inbound reply
  wakes them sooner. **Snoozed** lets you bring them back immediately. The existing
  minute-by-minute scheduled worker processes due conversations.
- **Settings → General → Sender rules** can label and archive new incoming mail
  from an exact address, optionally matching text in the subject. Rules are
  account-specific, run atomically with ingestion, and can be disabled or removed.

## Choosing a mail provider

One provider is active per deploy, selected by `EMAIL_PROVIDER` (`resend` is
the default, `cloudflare` is the alternative). Do not point the same domain's
apex MX at both.

|                 | [Resend](https://resend.com)             | [Cloudflare Email Service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/) |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Outbound        | Resend API                               | Workers `env.EMAIL.send()`                                                    |
| Inbound         | Webhook → `/api/webhooks/resend`         | Worker `email()` handler                                                      |
| DNS             | Any DNS host                             | **Cloudflare DNS required**                                                   |
| Cost            | Resend free tier + Cloudflare            | Requires a **Workers paid** plan                                              |
| Delivery events | `delivered`, `bounced`, `complained`, …  | Accepted send is stored as `sent`                                             |

Pick Resend if your DNS lives elsewhere or you already use it. Pick Cloudflare
Email if the zone is already on Cloudflare and you want everything on one account.

## Manual setup

Only needed if you cannot run the wizard.

### 1. Install

```bash
bun install          # or: npm install
bunx wrangler login
```

Cloudflare Email Sending needs **Wrangler 4.123+** (older versions hit a
removed API path and 404).

### 2. Create D1 and R2

```bash
bunx wrangler d1 create quickmail
bunx wrangler r2 bucket create quickmail-attachments
```

Copy the printed `database_id` into `wrangler.jsonc` (replacing
`REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_D1_DATABASE_ID`), then run migrations:

```bash
bun run db:migrate:remote
```

To serve from your own hostname, uncomment the `routes` block in
`wrangler.jsonc` — the zone must be on the same Cloudflare account.

Then follow **exactly one** provider track below.

### Track A — Resend

1. **Verify the domain** in Resend (**Domains → Add Domain**) and add every
   record they show, including the apex `MX` — without it, mail never arrives.
   Enable **sending and receiving** on the domain.

2. **Set the API key** (create it with full access — send + domains + receiving):

   ```bash
   bunx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Deploy, then create the webhook** (the URL must be public):

   ```bash
   bun run deploy
   ```

   In [Resend → Webhooks](https://resend.com/webhooks) add a webhook pointing to
   `https://<your-worker-url>/api/webhooks/resend` with the events
   `email.received`, `email.sent`, `email.delivered`, `email.bounced`,
   `email.complained`, `email.delivery_delayed`, `email.failed`.

4. **Save the signing secret** (shown once) and redeploy:

   ```bash
   bunx wrangler secret put RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   bun run deploy
   ```

While testing, a DMARC record on `_dmarc` is recommended:
`v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:you@yourdomain.com; pct=100; adkim=s; aspf=s`
(tighten to `p=quarantine` later).

### Track B — Cloudflare Email Service

The zone must use **Cloudflare DNS**.

1. **Onboard the domain** for both
   [Email Sending](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/email-service/sending)
   and [Email Routing](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/email-service/routing)
   in the dashboard, or with Wrangler 4.123+:

   ```bash
   bunx wrangler email sending enable yourdomain.com
   bunx wrangler email routing enable yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Route inbound mail to the Worker.** In the Email Routing dashboard, enable
   **Catch-all** with the action **Send to a Worker** → this app. The catch-all
   is what lets users create arbitrary addresses in Settings. (This step is
   dashboard-only — the CLI can't set a Worker as the catch-all action.)

3. **Configure the Worker** in `wrangler.jsonc` and deploy:

   ```jsonc
   "vars": {
     "EMAIL_PROVIDER": "cloudflare",
     "CLOUDFLARE_MAIL_DOMAINS": "yourdomain.com" // comma-separate multiple domains
   }
   ```

   ```bash
   bun run deploy
   ```

Inbound mail only works on a **deployed** Worker (or `bun run preview`) —
`vite dev` never runs the `email()` handler.

## First run

1. Open the deployed URL.
2. Visit `/setup` — pick a domain and create the admin account (name,
   address, password). That address is both the inbox and the login.
3. Later users claim addresses through `/onboarding`.

Send yourself a message from another account — it should land within seconds.

### Private webmail deployments

Two optional Worker variables restrict the exposed routes. Set their values to
the string `"true"` in your deployment's `wrangler.jsonc`:

- `DISABLE_PUBLIC_SETUP` blocks `/setup` and `/api/setup`. Enable it after
  provisioning the administrator; it does not disable new-user onboarding.
- `DISABLE_EXTERNAL_AUTH` blocks OAuth, MCP, API-key management, CLI pairing,
  and the CLI installer. Browser login and mail delivery remain available.
  Existing API keys are not revoked by this flag.

Password changes revoke existing sessions, API keys, pairing codes, OAuth codes,
and OAuth grants. Concurrent external credential issuance still needs further
hardening, so keep `DISABLE_EXTERNAL_AUTH` enabled for a webmail-only installation.
Keep personal deployment settings and secrets out of commits to a public fork.

### Two-factor authentication

Authenticator-app 2FA is available in **Settings → General**. The administrator
must first apply migrations and configure `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` as a Worker secret:
a base64-encoded, cryptographically random 32-byte key. Keep a secure backup of
this key with your database backups. Never commit it or put it in public Worker
variables. Local development can supply it in the ignored `.dev.vars` file.
Changing or deleting the key makes existing authenticator secrets unreadable;
key rotation requires re-encrypting them. Recovery codes still work without it.

Users confirm their password, scan the QR code, verify one code, and save ten
single-use recovery codes outside their mailbox. Enrollment expires after ten
minutes. Enabling 2FA, turning it off, or generating replacement recovery codes
signs out existing sessions and revokes client credentials. New sign-ins require
the password plus an authenticator or recovery code. Authenticator codes cannot
be reused; wait for the next code after confirming enrollment.

Password resets, including the administrator recovery script, **preserve 2FA**.
Disabling 2FA or replacing recovery codes requires the password and a valid
second factor. If both the authenticator and all recovery codes are lost, the
Cloudflare account owner must perform an explicit administrative recovery; a
password reset alone will not bypass 2FA. This version supports browser 2FA only:
API keys, OAuth/MCP and mobile sessions cannot authenticate enrolled accounts.
Passkeys and remembered-device exemptions are not implemented.

The migration is additive, but an older Worker does not know how to complete
2FA. Do not roll back to an older application version after users enroll without
planning account recovery. Run `bun run check`, `bun run test`, and `bun run build`
before deploying changes to authentication.

### Several accounts in one browser

If you have access to more than one mailbox on the same instance, use
**Add account** in the account menu to sign in to another one without signing
out. The menu then lists every signed-in account; pick one to switch (up to 5).
**Log out** leaves only the active account and drops you into the next one;
**Log out of all accounts** ends every session. Each account keeps its own
session, so revoking one from Settings → Devices does not affect the others.

### Desktop notifications (optional)

Quickinbox can push-notify users about new mail even with no tab open:

```bash
bunx web-push generate-vapid-keys
bunx wrangler secret put VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY
bunx wrangler secret put VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY
bunx wrangler secret put VAPID_SUBJECT   # e.g. mailto:admin@example.com
bun run db:migrate:remote
bun run deploy
```

Users opt in under **Settings → Desktop notifications**. Don't rotate the key
pair after users subscribe, or they'll have to re-enable.

### Telegram notifications (optional)

Every inbound message can also ping a Telegram chat — useful for a mailbox you
watch from your phone without installing anything:

```bash
bunx wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN   # from @BotFather
bunx wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID     # from @userinfobot; negative for groups
bun run deploy
```

If the chat is a forum supergroup, add `TELEGRAM_THREAD_ID` for the topic to
post into — without it Telegram puts the message in General. Add `APP_URL` to
`vars` in `wrangler.jsonc` to link your install from each notification. Both secrets are required — leave either unset and notifications
stay off. This works on both provider tracks, and mail that matched no mailbox
is announced too, so a missing route is visible instead of silent.

Each message arrives as a single rich message — subject, sender, the body in
an expandable quote, every attachment inline with its size, and a link straight
to the conversation. That needs Bot API 10.1; against an older API the call
fails and the notification falls back to a text card followed by the files.

Delivery is fire-and-forget: a Telegram outage is logged and ignored rather
than failing the inbound handler, which the provider would then retry.

### Inbox tabs (optional)

Inbound mail can be sorted into Gmail-style tabs — Primary, Social, Promotions,
Updates, Forums — with spam in its own mailbox. The Deploy to Cloudflare button
asks for `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`; `bun run setup` prompts for the same key (or take
`--typesafe-api-key`). To set it later:

```bash
bunx wrangler secret put TYPESAFE_API_KEY
bun run deploy
```

Without the key, everything lands in Primary. Users can still move conversations
between tabs, report spam, and create custom labels in Settings. Classification
errors also fail open into Primary so mail is never hidden.

Mail that arrived before the key was set stays in Primary until the owner runs
**Classify** under Settings → Labels → Inbox tabs. The page updates after every
message; notifications are not sent for that backfill.

Promotions and Social do not send push/Telegram notifications. High-confidence
spam is filed silently.

## Development

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars    # fill in the provider you're using
bun install
bun run db:migrate:local
bun run dev
```

| Command           | Purpose                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bun run dev`     | Vite dev server (D1/R2 via platformProxy)                |
| `bun run preview` | Production build + `wrangler dev` (Cloudflare inbound)   |
| `bun run check`   | svelte-check                                             |
| `bun run test`    | Unit tests                                               |
| `bun run deploy`  | Build, wrap the Worker with `email()`, deploy            |

**Testing inbound with Resend:** webhooks can't reach `localhost`, so tunnel it
(`cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173`) and point a **throwaway**
webhook at the tunnel — never repoint production.

**Testing inbound with Cloudflare Email:** use `bun run preview` or a deploy.

**Forgot the admin password:**

```bash
bun scripts/reset-admin-password.mjs you@example.com newpassword --local
```

## API access

Any user can mint a long-lived API key under **Settings → API keys** and use it
as a bearer token:

```sh
curl https://your-worker/api/mail \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qi_live_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to": "you@example.com", "subject": "hello", "text": "hi"}'
```

`GET /api/mail?view=inbox` lists conversations. Keys are scoped (`mail:read`,
`mail:send`, admin) and only the SHA-256 hash is stored — the raw value is
shown once. Revoking a key takes effect immediately. New keys start with
`qi_live_`; existing `qm_live_` keys keep working after you pull this update.

## MCP (hosted, with OAuth)

Every instance is a remote MCP server. Add its URL to Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT,
or any client that speaks Streamable HTTP, and the client walks you through a
sign-in in the browser — no API key to paste:

```
https://mail.example.com/mcp
```

The consent screen shows which app is asking (with its real logo), exactly
what it will be allowed to do, and which of your signed-in accounts it will act
as. Approve, and the client receives an OAuth token scoped to that account.
Disconnect any app later from **Settings › Connections › AI assistants (MCP)**;
its tokens stop working immediately.

Tools: `whoami`, `list_threads`, `search_mail`, `get_thread`, `list_attachments`
(scope `mail:read`), `send_message`, `reply`, `update_thread` (scope `mail:send`).
A client that asks for only `mail:read` never sees the send tools.

Under the hood this is a standard OAuth 2.1 authorization server (RFC 8414 and
RFC 9728 discovery, RFC 7591 dynamic registration, PKCE S256, refresh-token
rotation with reuse detection, RFC 7009 revocation); public clients only. A
`qi_live_` API key also works as a bearer token on `/mcp`, so existing CLI
setups can point at it too.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` | Which server issues tokens for `/mcp` |
| `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | Endpoint list, scopes, PKCE methods |
| `POST /oauth/register` | Dynamic client registration |
| `GET /oauth/authorize` | Consent screen |
| `POST /oauth/token` | Code exchange and refresh |
| `POST /oauth/revoke` | Revoke a token |

## CLI and MCP (local)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfaulkingham/quickinbox/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
quickinbox login --url https://<your-instance> --token <key from Settings>
quickinbox inbox
quickinbox send --to someone@example.com --subject "Hi" --body "Hello"
```

The same credentials drive a local stdio MCP server, useful when a client cannot
do OAuth or you want several instances behind one server (see below):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quickinbox": {
      "command": "quickinbox",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "QUICKINBOX_URL": "https://mail.example.com",
        "QUICKINBOX_TOKEN": "qi_live_…"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`quickinbox` is the launcher from the install script (`~/.local/bin/quickinbox`).
`quickmail` is the same binary. Login once, or set `QUICKINBOX_URL` and
`QUICKINBOX_TOKEN` as above (`QUICKMAIL_URL` / `QUICKMAIL_TOKEN` still work).

Tools: `list_accounts`, `list_threads`, `get_thread`, `search_mail`,
`send_message`, `reply`, `list_attachments`.

### Multiple accounts

If you have inboxes on several Quickinbox instances, log in to each one. Every
login is saved as an account (named after the host unless you pass `--account`);
the first one becomes the default.

```bash
quickinbox login --url https://mail.alter.rw --token qi_live_… --account alter
quickinbox login --url https://mail.cursorrwanda.com --token qi_live_… --account rwanda
quickinbox accounts                 # * alter  https://mail.alter.rw
                                    #   rwanda https://mail.cursorrwanda.com
quickinbox inbox --all-accounts     # every inbox in one list, tagged [alter] / [rwanda]
quickinbox search invoice --all-accounts
quickinbox read <id> --account rwanda
quickinbox accounts use rwanda      # change the default
quickinbox logout --account alter   # or `logout --all`
```

Every command takes `--account <name>` (`-a`). `QUICKINBOX_ACCOUNT` selects the
default; `QUICKINBOX_URL` + `QUICKINBOX_TOKEN` add an account that always wins.

The MCP server exposes all saved accounts at once. Each tool accepts an optional
`account`; `list_threads` and `search_mail` query every account when it is
omitted and tag each thread with its `account`, while `get_thread`, `reply`, and
`list_attachments` find the account that owns the id automatically. Use
`list_accounts` to see what is configured. `send_message` uses the default
account unless told otherwise. Config lives in
`~/.config/quickinbox/config.json`; an existing single-account file keeps
working and is upgraded on the next login.

## Internationalization

The UI ships in English, French, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish. Language is stored
on the account (Settings → Appearance) and in a `qi_locale` cookie — URLs stay the
same. Email bodies are never translated.

Catalogs live in `messages/`. After editing `messages/en.json`, generate the other
locales with [General Translation](https://generaltranslation.com):

```bash
# GT_API_KEY and GT_PROJECT_ID from https://generaltranslation.com/dashboard
bun run translate
```

CI does the same on pushes to `main` (and on a manual **CI** workflow run). Set
repository secrets `GT_API_KEY` and `GT_PROJECT_ID` — never commit them. The
translate job opens a PR with updated catalogs.

## How inbound routing works

Both providers accept every address on a connected domain. The app then routes:

1. Exact match in `addresses` → that user
2. Else the domain's catch-all owner (admin) → that user
3. Else stored as unrouted and listed in the admin view

## Project structure

```

  worker.ts          SvelteKit fetch + Cloudflare email() inbound
  routes/            inbox, compose, drafts, settings, admin, setup
  lib/
    components/      sidebar, mailbox, composer, thread view
    server/          providers, inbound, D1, auth

```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `wrangler email sending enable` → 404 | Wrangler too old — upgrade to 4.123+ |
| Mail never arrives (Resend) | `dig MX yourdomain.com` must point at Resend; enable receiving on the domain |
| Mail never arrives (Cloudflare) | Apex MX must be Cloudflare Routing, catch-all must target this Worker, `EMAIL_PROVIDER=cloudflare`, Worker must be deployed |
| Webhook 401 | `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` mismatch — secrets are shown once; recreate the webhook |
| Webhook 500 | `bunx wrangler tail` |
| Attachments missing | R2 bucket must exist and match `bucket_name` in `wrangler.jsonc` |
| `database_id` errors on deploy | Paste the id from `wrangler d1 create` into `wrangler.jsonc` |
| Setup shows no Cloudflare domains | Set `CLOUDFLARE_MAIL_DOMAINS` and `EMAIL_PROVIDER=cloudflare`, restart the dev server |
